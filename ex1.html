      wanna miss a thing every night when i look in the mirror, All these lines
      on my face getting clearer. the past has gone. woo, It went by like dust dawn
      . Isn't that the way, everybody's got there due. I know, nobody knows. where
      it goes and when it goes. I know, it's everybody sin. you gotta do the pay
      how to win. half my life is in books written pages, lived and learned from
      fools and from sages. the time has gone. All the thing's comeback to you,
      sing with me sing for the year, sing for the laugher, sing for the tears.
      sing witn me just for today. maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away.
